## Ingredients:

- 2 lbsÂ  long-grain rice
- 2 boxes of vegetable broth
- 1 (16 oz) can chunky picante salsa
- 4-6 tbsp vegetable oil

## Instructions:

### 1. Toast the Rice:

Heat 4-6 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.

Add the unrinsed rice and stir frequently for 5-7 minutes until the grains are well coated and turn slightly golden.

### 2. Cook the Rice:

Pour in both boxes of vegetable broth. Stir well.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice absorbs all the liquid and is fully cooked.

### 3. Add the Picante Salsa:

Once the rice is cooked, stir in the entire can of chunky picante salsa. Mix well to distribute the flavors evenly.

Remove from heat. Let sit for 2-3 minutes so the flavors blend.

### 4. Fluff & Serve:

Fluff the rice with a fork and serve warm.
