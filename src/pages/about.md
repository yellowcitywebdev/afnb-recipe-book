Amarillo Food Not Bombs is a grassroots, volunteer-run collective dedicated to sharing free, nutritious meals with the community. Rooted in the belief that food is a human right, not a privilege, the group rescues surplus food that would otherwise go to waste and serves it to those in need. Operating without hierarchy or political affiliation, Amarillo Food Not Bombs challenges hunger, poverty, and systemic injustice through direct action and mutual aid. Their work fosters solidarity and builds a more compassionate, self-sustaining community where everyone has access to nourishing food.

## The Recipe Book

This is a project to gather all of our recipes into a single online location. This way, not only will it be readily available to our volunteers, but it will also be available to anyone wanting to make large amounts of food for people.

## Where can you find us?

We operate out of Elwood Park at 1100 S Jackson St every Saturday at 3pm.

## Clothing Donations

Amarillo Food Not Bombs not only provides free, nutritious meals but also offers donation-based clothing to those in need. By redistributing surplus food and gently used clothing, the group fosters mutual aid and community support, ensuring that everyone has access to essentials. No questions asked, no strings attachedâ€”just solidarity in action.
